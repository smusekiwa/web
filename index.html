        <p>We love learning and finding out more about our zodiac signs but there is so much more to astrology than just reading your horoscope for the day, particularly when it comes to better understanding your own personality, as well as the connections between the signs in the zodiac        
            it can be helpful to understand the ways your zodiac sign's element affects your life, as it'll give you a deeper understanding of astrology as a whole.  
        </p>
        <p>Leo, Aries, and Sagittarius are the fire signs who carry their passion and drive with them everywhere they go. Meanwhile, air signs Gemini, Aquarius, and Libra propel the world forward using their intellect and mental prowess. Water signs Scorpio, Pisces, and Cancer keep people in touch with their emotions by feeling all of their feelings, all the time. 
            And the earth signs Virgo, Capricorn, and Taurus remind us all to stay grounded and embrace practicality, even when it's difficult. The signs and their corresponding elements work in perfect synchronicity with each other to teach us these lessons</p>
